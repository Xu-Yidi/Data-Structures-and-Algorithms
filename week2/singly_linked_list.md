- **Linked List**<br>
1.A linked structure contains a collection of objects called nodes, each of which contains data and at least one reference or link to another node<br>
2.A linked list is a structure in which the nodes are connected in sequence to form a linear list<br>
>>(1)The first node in the list(***head node***), must be named or referenced by external variable<br>
>>(2)The last node in the list(***tail node***), is indicated by a null link reference<br>
>>(3)A linked list can be empty, which can be indicated when the head reference is null<br>
- **The Singly Linked List**<br>
1.a singly linked list is a linked list in which each node contains a single link field and allows for a complete traversal from a distinctive first node to the last<br>
